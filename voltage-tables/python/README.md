# Creating Voltage Tables with Python

This directory contains some python scripts to help you get started with making your own voltage tables in a more automated fashion than the ER-101/102 interface can provide.

* chromatic/generate.py - Various scales constructed on top of the 12 chromatic scale degrees.
* csv/csv-to-voltage-table.py - converts voltage table in CSV format to the binary format required by the ER-102.
* csv/test.csv - an example CSV file to use for testing the csv-to-voltage-table.py script.
* just-intonation.py - an example of an algorithmically generated scale.
